# Rocker-Bogie-Mars-Rover
This project was to construct an autonomous robot to be able to scale the surface of Mars.
Given Mars has an unpredictable and uneven surface the robot would have to maintaining a level body throughout motion in order to keep valuable components within the robot safe. 
Keeping a level body is essential and was done using a differential gear system.
The robot used an Arduino to implement the autonomous behaviour. 
I have attached all the 3D modeled parts, the final assembly as well as renders of the final product. Moreover, a tenchincal report is also attached explaining the process and solution method.
